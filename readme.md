The code generates data using the specified model, embeds it using the specified model, then trains a simple regression model and optimizes it using three algorithms: GD, SGD, and ADAM. It also generates many Visualizations: Time vs Loss, Time vs Accuracy, Epoch vs Loss, Epoch vs Accuracy, and the 2D-reduced w (Using t-SNE).
